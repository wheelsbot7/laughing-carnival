Now, right off the bat, what the hell do I mean by "not hard, just complicated"? By that I mean homelabbing is something really easy to set up and do, provided you already have a truckload of preexisting knowledge about networking, remote administration, and Docker. It's ultimately plugging square pegs into square holes, finding out it doesn't fit, searching "square peg square hole not fitting" on StackOverflow and finding out there's a secret square hole you should be using because the obvious square hole on the front doesn't accept purple squares and this has been a problem since 1997, the secret square hole was a band-aid fix that should've been reworked years ago but now every square is built with the assumption that there are 2 slightly different square holes so fixing it now would do more harm than good.
