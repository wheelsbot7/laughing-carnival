If you're online enough to be reading this, I'm sure you're familiar with "Dead
Internet Theory". It's mostly a cynical hypothesis that exists to cope about the
lack of human connection on a platform specifically designed for it, but the
sentiment behind it is more valid than you might think. The internet isn't dead
or dying, but a greater proportion of it is being used by parasites. Bad
actors[^1] that abuse the HTTP protocol for bad-faith reasons.

[^1]:
    Total tangent, but I never understood the term "bad actor" in this context.
    Like, what do you mean this high school theater kid is taking advantage of
    systems not designed for them? They should be singing Hamilton unprompted in
    the back of their school bus, making sure nobody will ever want to sit next
    to them, as is their (my) right.
