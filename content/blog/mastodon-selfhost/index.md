First off, let's get one thing out of the way. You probably shouldn't do this.
There are already a ton of guides on how to host Mastodon on Debian-based
distros. If you're doing this on a fresh machine, go with Ubuntu 22.04 and use
the [official guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/prerequisites/). Arch
isn't a great server operating system. Its whole deal is being lightweight and
getting updates to the user as fast as possible. Servers need over a terabyte to
be useful and they don't update unless it's necessary. I only did this because I
know how to administer Arch and I already had a homelab running Arch with a few
services. Regardless, if you aren't willing to switch, here's what you need to
do.
