## [Where's the Shovelware? Why AI Coding Claims Don't Add Up](https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding)

A great piece from a former AI optimist who became disillusioned with the
technology and its promises at a very basic, input/output level.

> "My argument: If so many developers are so extraordinarily productive using
> these tools, where is the flood of shovelware? We should be seeing apps of all
> shapes and sizes, video games, new websites, mobile apps,
> software-as-a-service apps — we should be drowning in choice. We should be in
> the middle of an indie software revolution. We should be seeing 10,000 Tetris
> clones on Steam."

## [Iconography of the X Window System: The Boot Stipple](https://matttproud.com/blog/posts/x-window-system-boot-stipple.html)

An extremely niche deep-dive on the origin and purpose of the X windowing
system's root window texture.

> "So why write about something that seems purely like an indulgence? Surely the
> stipple still lives with us today and requires no further discussion? Well, up
> until the early-2010s (at least on the Linux distributions I was using), this
> boot up scene was common to see — until it suddenly wasn’t."

## [I Am An AI Hater](https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html)

The title's a bit harsh, I know, but this article _goes places_. Extremely
worthwhile idealogical critique of AI. Plus it's only like 2 pages long, go read
it!

> "Altman tells lies for money. And I’m glad they’re lies. Because the makers of
> AI aren’t damned by their failures, they’re damned by their goals. They want
> to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has
> to make art again"

## [Email is Easy](https://e-mail.wtf/)

Step right up and test your knowledge! Simply identify if the given email
address is valid or not! Discover intricacies of the RFC 5322 Internet Message
Format standard you never even asked for! Can't get enough? Try the
[JSdate](https://jsdate.wtf/) quiz from the same author and try to identify
valid JavaScript dates!

> "`normal(wtf␣is␣this?)@example.com`? Technically valid. Did you know emails
> could have comments? Anything (in parens) is a comment. Introduced in RFC 822,
> but made obsolete by RFC 5322."

## [Apple Rankings](https://applerankings.com/)

Yes, it is _technically_ a website rating different varieties of apples.
However, the writing style is practically burning with passion. This isn't some
"Apples Weekly" joint or Buzzfeed-tier ranking, this is for the real
apple-heads.

> "Oh how the mighty have fallen! Believe it or not, the coffee grinds in a
> leather glove known as “The Red Delicious Apple” was once a robust firebrand
> credited with reinventing the apple from mere cider-fruit into a full-fledged
> lunch-worthy sidepiece. It even won the Stark Brothers apple contest in 1894.
> Likely your great-grandma’s favorite apple, this once flavorful Prometheus has
> been mass-produced into desolation."

## [Coding Without a Laptop - Two Weeks with AR Glasses and Linux on Android](https://holdtherobot.com/blog/2025/05/11/linux-on-android-with-ar-glasses/)

The smartphone market has stagnated surprisingly fast in the last decade or so,
but this project shows the first novel way to package a portable computer since
the iPhone. All for ~$250 if you already have a decent android phone!

> "I do feel a little weird wearing these in public, but not that weird. They
> more or less pass for sunglasses, so the odd part is wearing sunglasses
> indoors and typing on a keyboard with nothing in front of you. I had couple
> people ask me about them, but they seemed to just think they were cool. One
> guy said he was going to buy a pair. That may be selection bias though; I'm
> sure some people thought I was an idiot."

## [Hell Is Overconfident Developers Writing Encryption Code](https://soatok.blog/2025/01/31/hell-is-overconfident-developers-writing-encryption-code/)

The main content of this article is very "shop talk" and impenetrable to the
layman, but the context makes it entertaining nonetheless. If you're the kind of
person to google every unfamiliar term, you'll definitely learn a thing or two.

> "I’ve seen people use md5($password) as their key derivation function for
> libsodium. I’ve seen people encrypt fields in a database, and then store the
> decryption key right next to the ciphertext. And then, in a stunning display
> of brilliance, they wrote decryption logic in SQL so they could query their
> database over encrypted fields. At least once, when reviewing an end-to-end
> encryption project that implemented cryptography in JavaScript intended to run
> in the web browser, my question of “how do you know which public key to
> trust?” was answered with something shaped like, “Oh, we just store those in
> MySQL and fetch them from the server.”"
