- [Where's the Shovelware? Why AI Coding Claims Don't Add Up](https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding)
  - A great piece from a former AI optimist who became disillusioned with the
    technology and its promises at a very basic, input/output level.
- [Iconography of the X Window System: The Boot Stipple](https://matttproud.com/blog/posts/x-window-system-boot-stipple.html)
  - An extremely niche deep-dive on the origin and purpose of the X windowing
    system's root window texture.
- [I Am An AI Hater](https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html)
  - The title's a bit harsh, I know, but this article _goes places_. Extremely
    worthwhile idealogical critique of AI. Plus it's only like 2 pages long, go
    read it!
- [Email is Easy](https://e-mail.wtf/)
  - Step right up and test your knowledge! Simply identify if the given email
    address is valid or not! Discover intricacies of the RFC 5322 Internet
    Message Format standard you never even asked for! Can't get enough? Try the
    [JSdate](https://jsdate.wtf/) quiz from the same author and try to identify
    valid JavaScript dates!
