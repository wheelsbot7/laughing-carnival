      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the displeasure of trying to get my laptop to connect to the&#xA;college Wi-Fi after they tightened their restrictions on endpoint management.&#xA;Long story short, I was forced to switch from Arch to Fedora, and I feel the&#xA;need to document the experience so that nobody will ever have to go through what&#xA;I did to avoid crawling back to Windows with my tail between my legs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re just here for an install guide, hop down to the numbered list. If&#xA;you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you should install Linux, read on!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linux has a (well deserved) reputation for being intimidating for newcomers, and&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a problem that needs to or even can be solved. The basic&#xA;model for selling operating systems isn&amp;rsquo;t exchanging money for functionality,&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s exchanging money for convenience. Nobody buys Taco Bell because it&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than what they can throw together at home, they buy it because they can&#xA;get food without the time and effort involved in making it themselves. In that&#xA;process they also defer the expertise involved in making a taco to an employee.&#xA;I know that&amp;rsquo;s a weird example, but you understand what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
