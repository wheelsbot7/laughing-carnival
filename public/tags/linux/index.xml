      <title>ï€“ The Wonderful World of Dotfiles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love it when names have a deeper meaning behind them, both linguistically and&#xA;conceptually. Those etymology charts in online dictionaries always fascinated&#xA;me, like little maps of interpretation. Conceptually, I have SCP-4000 to thank&#xA;for my love of name-based magic. Oh, sorry I meant to say&#xA;&lt;span style=&#39;color:green; font-weight: bold;&#39;&gt;THAT ONE PLACE WITH THE FAIRIES IN&#xA;A FOREST THAT CAN&amp;rsquo;T BE REFERRED TO WITH THE SAME NAME TWICE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as you&amp;rsquo;ve probably guessed, today I want to talk about something named so&#xA;literally I can&amp;rsquo;t help but love it. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing to read into, nothing to&#xA;extract hidden meaning from. It&amp;rsquo;s as subtle as a sledgehammer and as elegant as&#xA;a cinder-block. Dotfiles are called that because hidden items in a file manager&#xA;are prefixed with a period. Personally, this radical simplicity is a breath of&#xA;fresh air. Not just the name, but hiding sensitive files behind such a&#xA;straightforward barrier. Windows requires you to type out &lt;code&gt;%appdata%&lt;/code&gt; every&#xA;single time, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s in &lt;code&gt;%localappdata%&lt;/code&gt; or the Documents folder or&#xA;some other app-specific folder. I&amp;rsquo;ve been confused by Linux&amp;rsquo;s lack of a &amp;ldquo;Program&#xA;Files&amp;rdquo; folder but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it if I can find the files I&amp;rsquo;ll actually edit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fedora fortinet install guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the displeasure of trying to get my laptop to connect to the&#xA;college Wi-Fi after they tightened their restrictions on endpoint management.&#xA;Long story short, I was forced to switch from Arch to Fedora, and I feel the&#xA;need to document the experience so that nobody will ever have to go through what&#xA;I did to avoid crawling back to Windows with my tail between my legs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The easy way to install Arch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re just here for an install guide, hop down to the numbered list. If&#xA;you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you should install Linux, read on!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linux has a (well deserved) reputation for being intimidating for newcomers, and&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s a problem that needs to or even can be solved. The basic&#xA;model for selling operating systems isn&amp;rsquo;t exchanging money for functionality,&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s exchanging money for convenience. Nobody buys Taco Bell because it&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than what they can throw together at home, they buy it because they can&#xA;get food without the time and effort involved in making it themselves. In that&#xA;process they also defer the expertise involved in making a taco to an employee.&#xA;I know that&amp;rsquo;s a weird example, but you understand what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
